//! Allows running timer callbacks without doing allocations at the time of

//!
//! # Vocabulary
//!
//! A timer is initialized in the **stopped** state. A stopped timer can be
//! **started** with an **expiry** time. After the timer is started, it is
//! **running**. When the timer **expires**, the timer handler is executed.
//! After the handler has executed, the timer may be **restarted** or
//! **stopped**. A running timer can be **cancelled** before it's handler is
//! executed. A timer that is cancelled enters the **stopped** state.

//! States:
//!
//! * Stopped
//! * Running

//! * Start
//! * Cancel
